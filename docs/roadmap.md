# Upcoming Projects & Roadmap

This document outlines some of the features currently in development or being considered for the project. It should not be confused with the product roadmap for WordPress itself, even if some areas naturally overlap. The main purpose of it is to give visibility to some of the key problems remaining to be solved and as an invitation for those wanting to collaborate on some of the more complex issues to learn about what needs help.

## Projects

- **WXR Library** — Create a standard library for handling WXR files. ([See overview](https://github.com/pento/free-as-in-speech/issues/3).)
- **Wix Exporting** — Our primary focus is currently to produce an MVP of a Wix exporter. ([See overview](https://github.com/pento/free-as-in-speech/issues/6).)
