# Design Contributions

A guide on how to get started contributing design to the *Free (as in Speech)* project.

## Discussions

The [Make WordPress Design blog](https://make.wordpress.org/design/) is the primary spot for the latest information around WordPress Design Team: including announcements, product goals, meeting notes, meeting agendas, and more.

Real-time discussions for design take place in the `#design` channel in [Make WordPress Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat) (registration required). Weekly meetings for the Design team are on Wednesdays at 19:00UTC.

## How Designers Can Contribute

The *Free (as in Speech)* project uses GitHub for managing code and tracking issues. The main repository is at: [https://github.com/pento/free-as-in-speech/](https://github.com/pento/free-as-in-speech/).

If you'd like to contribute to the design of this project, feel free to contribute to tickets labeled [Needs Design](https://github.com/pento/free-as-in-speech/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Needs+Design%22) or [Needs Design Feedback](https://github.com/pento/free-as-in-speech/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"Needs+Design+Feedback%22). We could use your thoughtful replies, mockups, animatics, sketches, doodles. Proposed changes are best done as minimal and specific iterations on the work that precedes it so we can compare.

The [WordPress Design team](http://make.wordpress.org/design/) uses [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to collaborate and share work. If you'd like to contribute, join the [#design channel](http://wordpress.slack.com/messages/design/) in [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) and ask the team to set you up with a free Figma account. This will give you access to a helpful [library of components](https://www.figma.com/file/ZtN5xslEVYgzU7Dd5CxgGZwq/WordPress-Components?node-id=0%3A1) used in WordPress.
