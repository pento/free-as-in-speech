# Free (as in Speech)

> You own the content you create. When a CMS tries to lock you in, this extension helps you break free.

Welcome to the *Free (as in Speech)* development hub! *FaiS* is a browser extension written for Firefox and Chrome, which allows you to export your site from Content Management Systems that don't otherwise provide you with an export.

## Getting Started

### Using Free (as in Speech)

*FaiS* is currently under heavy development, and isn't recommended for general use. If you're comfortable with building software from source, you're welcome to experiment with it, but please be aware that it may not function as expected for you.

If you do try out *FaiS*, please let us know how you go! We love to hear feedback from everyone.

### Contribute to Free (as in Speech)

*FaiS* is an open-source project and welcomes all contributors from code to design, from documentation to triage. We'd love your help building it!

See the [Contributing Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on getting started.

As with all WordPress projects, we want to ensure a welcoming environment for everyone. With that in mind, all contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
